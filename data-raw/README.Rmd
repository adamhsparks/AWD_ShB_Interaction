Two files in this directory detail the pre-processing of disease data, [import_and_preprocess.md](import_and_preprocess.md) and an R script, [IRRI_weather_data.R](IRRI_weather_data.R) that imports weather data for 2015 and 2016 and runs statistical checks to ensure that the dry seasons in each year are not statistically different.
