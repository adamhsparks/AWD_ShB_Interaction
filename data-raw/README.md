Data Raw Files
================

Two files in this directory detail the pre-processing of disease data,
[import\_and\_preprocess.md](import_and_preprocess.md) and an R script,
[IRRI\_weather\_data.R](IRRI_weather_data.R) that imports weather data
for 2015 and 2016 and runs statistical checks to ensure that the dry
seasons in each year are not statistically different.
