  abstract   = {Rice is the most rapidly growing staple food in Africa and although rice production is steadily increasing, the consumption is still out-pacing the production. In Tanzania, two important diseases in rice production are leaf blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The objective of this study was to quantify rice yield losses due to these two important diseases under a changing climate. We found that bacterial leaf blight is predicted to increase causing greater losses than leaf blast in the future, with losses due to leaf blast declining. The results of this study indicate that the effects of climate change on plant disease can not only be expected to be uneven across diseases but also across geographies, as in some geographic areas losses increase but decrease in others for the same disease.},

  abstract   = {The structure of a model for rice sheath blight which integrates processes at the tiller level and their contribution to epidemics is reported. The model considers two processes, primary and secondary infection, leading to disease increase. It incorporates disease aggregation in terms of accessibility of healthy tillers to infection by the pathogen from diseased tillers. Parameters from the model were derived either empirically or by numerical optimisation from published data, and from a field experiment. A separate field experiment was conducted for model evaluation. The model has the potential to adequately account for actual epidemics. Sensitivity analysis showed that the intrinsic rate of secondary infection had a large effect on simulated epidemics, while effect of the intrinsic rate of primary infection was comparatively small. The aggregation parameter had a strong effect on simulated epidemics in their later stages. The model adequately simulated the pattern of actual epidemiological data, except in the later stage of epidemics, when it failed to account for decrease in disease incidence at the tiller level. The model was considered to comply with the requirements of a preliminary simulation model, and approaches to improve its performances are discussed.},

  abstract      = {China's grain basket in the North China Plain is threatened by increasing water scarcity and there is an urgent need to develop water-saving irrigation strategies. Water savings in rice can be realized by alternate wetting and drying (AWD) under lowland conditions, or by aerobic rice in which the crop is grown under nonflooded conditions with supplemental irrigation. Field experimentation and simulation modelling are a powerful combination to understand complex crop-water interactions and to extrapolate site-specific empirical results to other environments and conditions. In this paper, we present results from 4 years of field experiments on \{AWD\} and aerobic rice in 2001{\^a}``2004 near Kaifeng, Henan Province, China. The experimental data were used to parameterize and evaluate the rice growth model ORYZA2000. A subsequent paper reports on the extrapolation of the experimental results using \{ORYZA2000\} and on farmer-participatory testing of aerobic rice. In the lowland area of the study site, rice yields under flooded conditions were around 8000 kg ha{\^a}'1 with 900 mm total (rain, irrigation) water input. Irrigation water savings were 40{\^a}``70% without any yield loss by applying AWD. In the upland area of the study site, aerobic rice yielded 2400{\^a}``3600 kg ha{\^a}'1, using 750{\^a}``1100 mm total water input. \{ORYZA2000\} satisfactorily reproduced the dynamics in measured crop variables (biomass, leaf area, N uptake) and soil water variables (ponded water depth, soil water tension). The root mean square error of predicted yield was 11% for lowland rice and 19% for aerobic rice, which was only one and a half times the error in the measured values. We concluded that \{ORYZA2000\} is sufficiently accurate to extrapolate our results on \{AWD\} and aerobic rice to different management and environmental conditions in our study area.},

  abstract   = {Sheath blight (ShB) disease, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is an economically important rice disease worldwide, especially in intensive production systems. Several studies have been conducted to identify sources for ShB resistance in different species of rice, including local accessions and landraces. To date, none of the genotypes screened are immune to ShB, although variation in levels of resistance have been reported. Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) for ShB resistance have been identified using mapping populations derived from indica or japonica rice. A total of 33 QTL associated with ShB resistance located on all 12 rice chromosomes have been reported, with ten of these co-localizing with QTL for morphological attributes, especially plant height, or for heading date. Sixteen QTL, from the same or differing genetic backgrounds, have been mapped at least twice. Of these, nine QTL were independent of morphological traits and heading date. We hypothesize that two main, distinct, mechanisms contribute to ShB resistance: physiological resistance and disease escape. Strategies to improve our understanding of the genetics of resistance to ShB are discussed.},

A study was conducted to determine the response of cultivars, with different levels of susceptibility, to sheath blight inoculations and fungicide application and to determine the impact of sheath blight disease development on rice yield and quality. Sheath blight epidemics in field plots were initiated by inoculation at the panicle differentiation growth stage in 2006 and 2007. Azoxystrobin at 0.17 kg a.i. ha was applied at mid-boot. Inoculation significantly increased sheath blight severity and incidence and caused yield losses of 8% in moderately resistant cv. Jupiter to 40% in very susceptible cv. Trenasse. Milling yields were affected to a lesser extent. Fungicide treatments reduced sheath blight incidence and severity, regardless of cultivar except in Jupiter. Single azoxystrobin applications were effective in minimizing yield loss due to sheath blight in all cultivars.},

  abstract   = {We review observational, experimental, and model results on how plants respond to extreme climatic conditions induced by changing climatic variability. Distinguishing between impacts of changing mean climatic conditions and changing climatic variability on terrestrial ecosystems is generally underrated in current studies. The goals of our review are thus (1) to identify plant processes that are vulnerable to changes in the variability of climatic variables rather than to changes in their mean, and (2) to depict/evaluate available study designs to quantify responses of plants to changing climatic variability. We find that phenology is largely affected by changing mean climate but also that impacts of climatic variability are much less studied, although potentially damaging. We note that plant water relations seem to be very vulnerable to extremes driven by changes in temperature and precipitation and that heatwaves and flooding have stronger impacts on physiological processes than changing mean climate. Moreover, interacting phenological and physiological processes are likely to further complicate plant responses to changing climatic variability. Phenological and physiological processes and their interactions culminate in even more sophisticated responses to changing mean climate and climatic variability at the species and community level. Generally, observational studies are well suited to study plant responses to changing mean climate, but less suitable to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant responses to climatic variability. Experiments seem best suited to simulate extreme events. In models, temporal resolution and model structure are crucial to capture plant responses to changing climatic variability. We highlight that a combination of experimental, observational, and/or modeling studies have the potential to overcome important caveats of the respective individual approaches.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The aim of this review was to survey all fungal pathologists with an association with the journal Molecular Plant Pathology and ask them to nominate which fungal pathogens they would place in a {\textquoteleft}Top 10{\textquoteright} based on scientific/economic importance. The survey generated 495 votes from the international community, and resulted in the generation of a Top 10 fungal plant pathogen list for Molecular Plant Pathology. The Top 10 list includes, in rank order, (1) Magnaporthe oryzae; (2) Botrytis cinerea; (3) Puccinia spp.; (4) Fusarium graminearum; (5) Fusarium oxysporum; (6) Blumeria graminis; (7) Mycosphaerella graminicola; (8) Colletotrichum spp.; (9) Ustilago maydis; (10) Melampsora lini, with honourable mentions for fungi just missing out on the Top 10, including Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Rhizoctonia solani. This article presents a short resum{\'{e}} of each fungus in the Top 10 list and its importance, with the intent of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant mycology community, as well as laying down a bench-mark. It will be interesting to see in future years how perceptions change and what fungi will comprise any future Top 10.},

  abstract   = {$\bullet$ Continuous planting of crops containing single disease resistance (R) genes imposes a strong selection for virulence in pathogen populations, often rendering the R gene ineffective. Increasing environmental temperatures may complicate R-gene-mediated disease control because high temperatures often promote disease development and reduce R gene effectiveness. Here, performance of one rice bacterial blight disease R gene was assessed in field and growth chamber studies to determine the influence of temperature on R gene effectiveness and durability. $\bullet$ Disease severity and virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) populations were monitored in field plots planted to rice with and without the bacterial blight R gene Xa7 over 11 yr. The performance of Xa7 was determined in high- and low-temperature regimes in growth chambers. $\bullet$ Rice with Xa7 exhibited less disease than lines without Xa7 over 11 yr, even though virulence of Xoo field populations increased. Xa7 restricted disease more effectively at high than at low temperatures. Other R genes were less effective at high temperatures. $\bullet$ We propose that Xa7 restricts disease and Xoo population size more efficiently in high temperature cropping seasons compared with cool seasons creating fluctuating selection, thereby positively impacting durability of Xa7.},

  abstract = {Plant response to one type of stress can be affected by simultaneous exposure to a second stress, for example when abiotic and biotic stresses occur together. Ten rice genotypes comprising those with bacterial blight (BB) resistance (R) genes, drought quantitative trait loci (QTLs) plus a BB R gene, and BB susceptible genotypes, were subjected to mild and moderate drought stress and plants were inoculated with two Xoo strains (PXO99 and PXO145) to simulate the challenges rice crops face under simultaneous stress of drought and BB. Plant height and dry shoot biomass were significantly reduced by drought stress treatments. The BB disease lesion lengths varied according to rice genotypes and PXO99 Xoo multiplication and spread in planta was higher compared to that of PXO145, which generally decreased under mild drought stress. Rice genotype IRBB7 (Xa7) showed less Xoo spread and a reduced Xoo multiplication under drought stress compared to the well-watered control with PXO145. In contrast, in genotypes with a different BB R gene and/or drought QTLs [IRBB4 (Xa4), IR87705--6-9-B (Xa4{~}+{~}qDYT2.2), IR87707--445-B-B-B (Xa4{~}+{~}qDYT2.2{~}+{~}qDYT4.1) and IR87707--446-B-B-B (Xa4{~}+{~}qDYT2.2{~}+{~}qDYT4.1)], Xoo multiplication and spread in planta was higher with drought stress. This study has shown that drought stress affected rice response to the BB pathogen and the response varied according to the rice genotype. It is concluded that evaluating rice varieties under combined abiotic and biotic stresses will be the best strategy to determine biotic stress resistance durability under climate change.},
